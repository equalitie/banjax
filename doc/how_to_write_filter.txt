* Adding a new filter

1) Inherit from BanjaxFilter.
2) Add the constant representing your filter to the top enum in banjax_filter.h e.g. 
  WHITE_LISTER_FILTER_ID,

3) Add the constant filter name in banjax_filter.h, e.g.:
   const std::string WHITE_LISTER_FILTER_NAME = "white_lister";

4) write the constructor to set the filter name and id.
5) Override the load_config, execute.
6) if it is needed override generate_response

7) in Banjax::filter_factory add the new name to the loop
8) include the filter header file in banjax.cpp
9) add the cpp file to the Makefile

* Allocating space in ip-db.
If a filter needs to keep state for the ips, during it creation banjax needs to know
how much memory the filter needs to allocate for each ip. It is not responsible of
filter for requesting huge amount of memory for each ip. Instead the filter needs to use 
pointer and allocate that memory itself on idividual bases.
